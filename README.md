# eMailTo:Clipboard

## Check out [eMailTo:Clipboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mailto-overide/dpckhpnekcojocijmcdpondmicbkbgpo) in the chrome store!

To use it, simply install the extension, then any time after that, if you click on an email address that would normally open your email client, it will just copy the address to your clipboard instead! That simple.
